Here is a list of queries I used to solve the murder mystery from the website https://mystery.knightlab.com/

From the description we learned the murder happened on Jan 15, 2018 in SQL city

select * from crime_scene_report
where date = '20180115'
and type = 'murder'
and city = 'SQL City'

From this report we learn that there were 2 witnesses. 
First witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr"
Second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave"

Now we need their interview statements

First witness query 

select * from interview
join person
on interview.person_id=person.id
where address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr'
order by address_number desc
limit 1

We learn first witness name is Morty Schapiro and he saw a man with a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".

second person 

select * from interview
join person
on interview.person_id=person.id
where person.name like 'Annabel%'
and address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave'

From this interview we learn that Annabel recognized the man from the gym when she went on Jan 9. 

Lets check the gym membership database

select * from get_fit_now_member gfnm
join get_fit_now_check_in gfnci
on gfnci.membership_id=gfnm.id
where membership_status = 'gold'
and check_in_date = '20180109'
and membership_id like '48Z%'

This brings two names: 
Joe Germuska
Jeremy Bowers

Let's check their interview statements. 

select p.name, i.transcript from interview i 
join person p 
on p.id=i.person_id
where p.name = 'Joe Germuska' or
p.name = 'Jeremy Bowers'

Joe Germuska doesn't pull up but Jeremy Bowers does. 
In his interview, he admits to the murder! However, he states that he was hired by a women with certain physical characteristics who had 'lots of money'. 
Lets find this women. 

We can look in the driver license databse (joinging person and income) because they list the characteristics give by Jeremy. 


select p.name, p.id, i.annual_income from person p
join drivers_license dl
on p.license_id=dl.id
join income i
on p.ssn=i.ssn
where hair_color = 'red'
and gender = 'female'
and car_make = 'Tesla'

Two women are listed. Now let's check in any of them attened the SQL Symphony Concert in December 2017 per Jeremy's statement.

select p.name from person p 
join facebook_event_checkin f
on p.id=f.person_id
where event_name = 'SQL Symphony Concert'
and date like '201712%'
and p.name like 'Miranda %'
or p.name like 'Red %'
group by p.name

Only Miranda Priestly shows up therefore she is the one who paid Jeremy.
