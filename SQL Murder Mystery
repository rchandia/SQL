Here is a list of queries I used to solve the murder mystery from the website https://mystery.knightlab.com/

From the description we learned the murder happened on Jan 15, 2018 in SQL city

select * from crime_scene_report
where date = '20180115'
and type = 'murder'
and city = 'SQL City'

From this report we learn that there were 2 witnesses. 
First witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr"
Second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave"

Now we need their interview statements

First witness query 

select * from interview
join person
on interview.person_id=person.id
where address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr'
order by address_number desc
limit 1

We learn first witness name is Morty Schapiro and he saw a man with a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".

second person 

select * from interview
join person
on interview.person_id=person.id
where person.name like 'Annabel%'
and address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave'

From this interview we learn that Annabel recognized the man from the gym when she went on Jan 9. 

Lets check the gym membership database

select * from get_fit_now_member gfnm
join get_fit_now_check_in gfnci
on gfnci.membership_id=gfnm.id
where membership_status = 'gold'
and check_in_date = '20180109'
and membership_id like '48Z%'
