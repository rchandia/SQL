In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


1. How many orders were placed in January?

select count(orderID) from jansales;

2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

select count(product) from jansales
where product='iPhone';

3. Select the customer numbers for all the orders that were placed in February

select acctnum 
from customers
join febsales
on febsales.orderID=customers.order_ID;

4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January and what was the price?

select product, price from jansales
order by price asc

OR

Select product, MIN(price)
from jansales

5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in Janaury?


select count(orderId) as "total_sold", product, price, count(orderId) * price as "revenue_by_item" from jansales
group by product

6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln, St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

select 
sum(Quantity), 
product, 
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

select count(distinct c.acctnum) as "Total_Customers", avg(quantity*price) as "Avg_Amount_Spent"
from febsales feb
join customers c
on c.order_ID=feb.orderID
where feb.quantity>2

8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February and how many of each were sold

select  product, sum(quantity) as total_sold
from febsales
where location like '%Los Angeles%'
group by product

9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).

select location, count(orderID) as "total orders"
from jansales
where location like '%NY%'
group by location
having count(orderID) > 2


10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?


select  count(orderId * quantity)as "total sold", product from febsales
where product like '%Headphones%'
group by product

11. What was the average amount spent per account in February? 

select  avg(quantity * price)
from febsales f
join customers c
on f.orderID=c.order_id


12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).

select avg(quantity)
from febsales f
join customers c
on f.orderID=c.order_id



13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

select product, sum(quantity * price) as revenue
from jansales
group by product
order by "revenue" desc
limit 1
