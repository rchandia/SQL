In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


1. How many orders were placed in January?

select count(orderID) from jansales;

2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

select count(product) from jansales
where product='iPhone';

3. Select the customer numbers for all the orders that were placed in February

select acctnum 
from customers
join febsales
on febsales.orderID=customers.order_ID;

4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January and what was the price?

select product, price from jansales
order by price asc

5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in Janaury?


select count(orderId) as "total_sold", product, price, count(orderId) * price as "revenue_by_item" from jansales
group by product

6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln, St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

select product, quantity, quantity*price as "total_revenue", location from febsales
where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'

7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

select count(distinct c.acctnum) as "Total_Customers", avg(quantity*price) as "Avg_Amount_Spent"
from febsales feb
join customers c
on c.order_ID=feb.orderID
where feb.quantity>2

8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February and how many of each were sold

select  product, sum(quantity) as total_sold
from febsales
where location like '%Los Angeles%'
group by product
